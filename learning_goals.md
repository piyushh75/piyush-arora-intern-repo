# 🚀 Internship Learning Goals

### 🎯 What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I aim to transition from lab-based environments to a live SOC setting, specifically learning to monitor system logs and alerts to detect real-world threats. I want to gain practical experience in identifying root causes during incident response and performing vulnerability assessments. Furthermore, I want to learn how to integrate these security findings into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure continuous security from code to production.

### 🛠️ What skills are you most excited to develop?
I am excited to advance my Wireshark proficiency for deep-packet analysis and master Burp Suite usage for professional threat detection and vulnerability scanning. I also look forward to refining my secure coding practices and exploring how security automation can be effectively integrated within the DevOps pipeline.

### 🤝 What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I bring a data-driven analytical mindset from my Cybersecurity and Data Science studies, allowing me to approach log reviews and threat detection with high attention to detail. I am ready to apply my knowledge of vulnerabilities and system monitoring to assist with vulnerability scanning, technical documentation, and bridging the gap between security requirements and developer workflows.

### 📈 What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I would like to improve my confidence in collaborating with developers on secure coding practices. While I understand the core security concepts, I want to learn how to effectively provide feedback to DevOps and product teams. My goal is to collaborate with them to ensure security is seamlessly integrated into the development lifecycle without slowing down production.

### ✅ What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success means becoming a reliable member of the team who can independently handle monitoring and risk mitigation tasks. By the end of the internship, I want to have developed a strong set of SOC analyst skills that allow me to make a measurable impact on the company’s security posture. Ultimately, I aim to use these insights to better support and secure the software development lifecycle.
