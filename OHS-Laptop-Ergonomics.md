# OHS Reflection: Laptop Ergonomics

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### 1. Risks of Using a Laptop Without External Peripherals
Using a laptop alone for extended periods forces the body into awkward, non-neutral positions:
* **Musculoskeletal Strain**: The low screen height leads to "Hunched Over Laptop Syndrome," causing strain on the neck, shoulders, and upper back.
* **Wrist & Hand Pain**: Compact keyboards and trackpads cause constrained hand postures, increasing the risk of Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI) like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
* **Eye Fatigue**: Smaller screens and closer proximity lead to visual fatigue and potential eye strain.

### 2. Ergonomic Equipment for Posture Improvement
To improve posture, it is essential to separate the screen from the input devices:
* **Laptop Stand**: Elevates the screen to eye level so the neck remains neutral.
* **External Keyboard & Mouse**: Allows arms and wrists to remain in a relaxed, 90-degree position.
* **Ergonomic Chair**: Provides lumbar support to maintain the natural curve of the spine.

### 3. Workspace Adjustments for Health
* **Monitor Height**: Align the top edge of the screen at or slightly below eye level so your gaze hits the upper third of the screen.
* **Chair Position**: Adjust height so thighs are parallel to the ground and feet are flat on the floor.
* **Desk Setup**: The surface should be at elbow height, with the keyboard and mouse roughly 10-15cm from the edge to support the forearms.

### 4. Daily Habits to Reduce Impact
* **The 20-20-20 Rule**: Every 20 minutes, look at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds to relax eye muscles.
* **Movement Breaks**: Stand up, walk, or stretch for 5 minutes every hour to improve circulation and reduce muscle tension.

## 📝 Personal Reflection

### Equipment Changes
To improve my current setup, I have purchased a **laptop stand** and an **external keyboard**. These changes allow me to keep my screen at a healthy viewing height while maintaining proper arm alignment. Additionally, I now wear **Blue Light Blocking Glasses** while working to reduce digital eye strain and protect my vision during long focus sessions.

### Behavioural Changes & Habits
I am strictly implementing the following daily routines to maintain my health:
* **The 20-20-20 Rule**: I now make it a habit to look away from the screen every 20 minutes to rest my eyes.
* **Scheduled Movement**: I ensure I stand up and stretch for 5 minutes every hour to improve my circulation.
* **Sitting Upright**: I am consciously using my chair's backrest for support rather than leaning forward toward the screen.

### Maintenance & Reminders
For immediate maintenance, I will **set a manual timer for 1 hour** as a reminder to check my posture and take a movement break. Moving forward, I will work on integrating the **Focus Bear app** to automate these reminders and better manage my focus sessions throughout the day.
