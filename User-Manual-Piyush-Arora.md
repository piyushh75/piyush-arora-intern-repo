# User Manual for Me

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### 1. What is a "User Manual for Me," and why do teams use them?

**Definition:** A "User Manual for Me" is a personal document that outlines how you work best, what you value in professional relationships, and how others can best interact with you.

**Purpose:** Teams use them to bridge the gap between different personalities and work styles, especially in remote environments where traditional social cues are missing.

**Efficiency:** It accelerates the "getting to know you" phase of a new internship, allowing you to hit the ground running with your supervisor and peers.

### 2. What categories are helpful to include?

**Communication Style:** Do you prefer direct messages (Discord) or structured updates (Email)? Are you someone who likes small talk or someone who gets straight to business?

**Work Habits & Hours:** When are you most productive? Do you prefer deep-work blocks or frequent collaborative check-ins?

**Feedback Preferences:** Do you prefer constructive feedback in real-time during a meeting, or would you rather read it in a document first so you can process it?

**Quirks & Values:** What are your "pet peeves" (e.g., vague meeting invites) and what values drive your work (e.g., accountability)?

### 3. How can writing a personal user manual improve teamwork and reduce misunderstandings?

**Sets Clear Expectations:** It removes the guesswork. If your manual says you don't check messages after 6 PM, teammates won't feel ignored when you don't reply until morning.

**Builds Psychological Safety:** By being vulnerable about your preferences and weaknesses, you encourage others to be open as well, fostering a more inclusive environment.

**Prevents Conflict:** Many workplace conflicts arise from differing communication styles; a manual addresses these differences before they lead to friction.

## 📝 Reflection: User Manual for Me

### 1. What do you need from teammates to do your best work?

**Direct Communication:** I value transparency and honesty; knowing exactly where a project stands helps me prioritize my security tasks.

**Detailed Instructions:** To avoid "winging it," I appreciate having clear project briefs and agendas for meetings so I can arrive prepared.

**Accountability:** I do my best when working with peers who are self-led and take initiative, as it fosters a high-performance environment.

### 2. How do you prefer to communicate?

**Async Messages:** For non-urgent technical updates, I prefer Discord or Email so I can maintain my focus during deep-work sessions.

**Quick Check-ins:** I like "snappy" meetings that stay on agenda rather than long, unstructured discussions.

**Tiered Escalation:** I follow the 48/24/2 rule—Email for general, Discord for medium priority, and SMS only for urgent security emergencies.

### 3. What helps you stay focused and productive?

**Structured To-Do Lists:** I rely on clear milestones and task lists to ensure I am making consistent progress on my internship goals.

**Deep Work Sessions:** I thrive when I have uninterrupted blocks of time to analyze logs or research security threats without frequent distractions.

**The "30-Minute Rule":** I stay productive by trying to solve problems myself for 30 minutes before reaching out for help, which keeps my learning active.

### 4. How do you like to give and receive feedback?

**Clear & Direct:** I prefer the Situation-Behaviour-Impact model because it focuses on specific actions and outcomes rather than personal traits.

**Written Feedback:** I appreciate receiving constructive feedback in writing so I can process it, learn from it, and adjust my habits accordingly.

**Gratitude:** I always express thanks for feedback, as I view it as a critical tool for my professional growth.

### 5. What are some quirks or things to know about your work style?

**Anonymization First:** I have a strict "Zero-PII" quirk; I will never pass raw logs to AI or external tools without scrubbing them first.

**Time to Process:** For complex security architecture discussions, I prefer to see the data or brief beforehand so I can provide a more thoughtful analysis.
