# Competitive Landscape: Focus Bear

---

## 1. What Makes Focus Bear Different?

Focus Bear isn't just a "wall" designed to lock you out of the internet; it's an **External Brain** built specifically for the ADHD and AuDHD experience.

While other apps act as simple "time blockers" that can feel restrictive or annoying, Focus Bear focuses on **Life Structuring**.

### The "External Brain"
It handles the executive function heavy-lifting. Instead of forcing you to remember your habits or decide what to do next, it sequences your life into manageable routines (Morning, Evening, and Focus Sessions).

### Smart Intent vs. Rigid Blocking
Our AI doesn't just block "YouTube" — it understands context. If you're watching a tutorial or a study video, the AI allows it because it aligns with your focus. It only steps in when you veer into "doomscrolling" territory, keeping you on track without hindering your actual work.

### Proactive Wellness
Unlike competitors that only care about "output," Focus Bear prioritizes the "input." By building in mandatory reminders for physical activity and meditation, it helps regulate dopamine levels and reduces the sensory overwhelm that often leads to burnout. It recognizes that movement isn't a distraction from work — it's the fuel for it.

## 2. Why Would a User Choose Focus Bear?

A user chooses Focus Bear when they are tired of "productivity hacks" that feel like they're fighting against their own brain. They choose it because:

- **It eliminates Decision Fatigue:** You don't have to "start" your day; the app starts it for you by guiding you through your first habit.
- **It's "Strict but Supportive":** It's hard to bypass (the "Grizzly" mode), but it feels like a coach rather than a prison because it provides the tools (videos, timers, guides) to help you succeed in your routine.
- **It respects "The Flow":** Features like Meeting Detection ensure that the app is smart enough to stay out of the way when you are actually being productive or in a call, removing the "annoyance factor" common in other blockers.

## 3. What's One Feature That Other Apps Have That Focus Bear Doesn't?

When looking at what other apps offer — like **Tiimo** — that Focus Bear doesn't, it really comes down to how they help you manage feeling overwhelmed. They do this in two specific ways:

### Auto-Breakdown for Big Tasks
If you have a heavy task like "Clean the Kitchen," the app automatically chops it up into tiny, easy steps (like "put away plates," "wipe counters"). This helps stop that "frozen" feeling when a task just feels too big to start.

### Planning by Energy
It lets you plan your day based on how tired or energetic you actually feel, rather than forcing you to stick to a rigid schedule on a day when you are burnt out.

## 4. Proposed Improvement for Focus Bear

Currently, Focus Bear's interface prioritizes comprehensive control, which can feel cluttered. A toggle to enter a **"Streamlined Mode"** would enhance the UX by focusing on the "Minimum Viable Productivity" needed to start a session.

### Key Benefits

- **Reduction of Choice Paralysis:** By hiding advanced settings and complex habit configurations, the app would help users who are easily overwhelmed get on track faster.
- **Essential Features Only:** In this mode, the home page would display only three core elements: the current habit/task, the timer, and a "Next" button.
- **Customizable Minimalism:** Users could select which "necessary features" appear in their simplified view — such as just the "Focus Timer" without the "Morning Routine" prompts — allowing for a personalized, distraction-free environment.
- **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Limiting the UI to essential data aligns with a "Very Cautious" thinking style, as it prevents the loss of productivity caused by spending too much time navigating the app's settings.

### Standard View vs. Simplified Mode

| Feature | Standard View (Current) | Simplified Mode (Proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| Habit visibility | Full habit stack visibility | Only the active habit or task |
| Analytics | Advanced analytics and "Dopamine" stats | A simple progress bar or "Current Streak" |
| Navigation | Multiple tabs for settings/routines | A single, clean home screen with a "Back to Full View" toggle |
| Suggestions | Proactive tips and "Out-of-the-box" suggestions | Silent, minimalist interface to avoid distraction |
