# Professionalism at Focus Bear

## 🔍 Research & Learn: Professional Standards at Focus Bear

### 1. Professional vs. Unprofessional Behaviour
In a casual work environment, professionalism is defined by **reliability and accountability** rather than formal attire.
* **Professional:** Arriving prepared with a clear agenda, taking initiative when stuck, providing consistent daily updates, and conducting a "10-second search" before escalating basic questions.
* **Unprofessional:** "Winging it" in meetings, multitasking during calls, "ghosting" projects, or pulling teammates off-task for excessive non-work conversations.

### 2. Respectful Communication in Remote Teams
Remote professionalism relies on clear signals and selecting the appropriate medium for the message.
* **Tone Sensitivity:** Messages are reviewed for dismissive or hostile tones, as facial expressions are absent in text.
* **Conflict Resolution:** If a text thread becomes tense, the conversation is escalated to a video call to "humanize" the interaction and resolve the issue faster.
* **Clarity:** Communication is concise, direct, and avoids unnecessary small talk when efficiency is required.

### 3. Giving and Receiving Feedback Professionally
Feedback is viewed as a tool for growth and operational efficiency, not a personal attack.
* **Giving Feedback:** The **Situation-Behaviour-Impact (SBI)** model is utilized, focusing strictly on specific, changeable actions and outcomes.
* **Receiving Feedback:** Active listening and clarifying questions are used instead of defensive reactions. Repeated feedback on the same topic is recognized as a signal that a necessary habit adjustment has been missed.

## 📝 Reflection: Professional Goals & Action Plan

### Effective Teamwork & Professionalism
Great teamwork is characterized by **shared accountability and transparency**. It is effective when team members provide "good vibes" and a positive attitude while remaining strictly accountable for their specific outputs. Valuing the ideas of peers while having the confidence to express original thoughts creates a high-functioning, collaborative environment.

### Steps for Clear, Respectful, and Inclusive Communication
* **Clarity:** Calendar invites include specific project names and short agendas to set clear expectations.
* **Inclusion:** Active listening is practiced during meetings, avoiding multitasking to ensure all voices are heard and information is not missed.
* **Directness:** Communications are kept concise and direct, ensuring efficiency while maintaining a respectful tone.
* **Clarification:** Questions are asked immediately when a task is unclear, rather than making assumptions that lead to errors.

### Creating a Positive and Professional Environment
* **Respect for Time:** Meetings are kept "snappy" and strictly adhere to the intended agenda.
* **Attitude:** A balance of "good vibes" and professional rigor is maintained.
* **Peer Support:** Teammates are treated as skilled peers, and their contributions are actively acknowledged.

### Preparing for Meetings with Supervisors and Colleagues
* **Pre-Meeting Research:** All project briefs, onboarding guides, and company materials (including the Focus Bear app) are reviewed thoroughly beforehand.
* **Self-Led Agendas:** Meetings are approached with a prepared list of questions or blockers, ensuring the intern is not simply waiting for the supervisor to lead the discussion.
* **Due Diligence:** A quick search (Google or AI) is performed before asking basic questions to demonstrate that "homework" has been completed.

### Proactivity During the Internship
* **The 30-Minute Rule:** If stuck, a search is conducted online or via teammates first. Supervisors are only reached out to after a "red-hot go."
* **Proposing Solutions:** Instead of waiting for tasks, next steps are proposed proactively (e.g., *"Based on my research, I think I should do X next. Is that what you'd recommend?"*).
* **Idle Time Management:** Initiative is taken to explore new tasks or help teammates whenever a primary task is completed.

### Follow-up and Escalation Protocol
Communication is escalated based on the urgency of the matter:
1. **Email:** General communications; expected reply within 48 hours.
2. **Discord/Teams:** Medium-priority; expected reply within 24 hours.
3. **SMS:** Urgent issues; expected response within 2 hours.
4. **Phone Call:** True emergencies only.
*Polite "nudges" are utilized if a request has been missed within the expected timeframe.*

### Commitments: What Will Not Occur
* **No Idleness:** Sitting idle or waiting for instructions without seeking work is avoided.
* **No "Winging It":** Arriving at meetings without preparation is unacceptable.
* **No Redundancy:** Skipping note-taking or asking questions that could be solved via a 10-second search is avoided.
* **No Ghosting:** At least one daily update is provided to ensure project visibility.
* **No Defensiveness:** Feedback is never ignored; it is used to loop back, learn, and adjust.
